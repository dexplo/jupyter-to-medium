Target User \u00b6 Do you .... Publish blog posts on Medium? Use Jupyter Notebooks to write the bulk of your post? Dislike the time and effort it takes to transfer your posts from Jupyter to Medium? If so, jupyter_to_medium will automate the process of taking your Jupyter Notebook as is and publishing it as a Medium post in almost no time at all saving huge amounts of time. Motivation \u00b6 I've published dozens of blog posts on Medium myself with all of them beginning as Jupyter Notebooks. Manually converting them to Medium posts was a fairly lengthy, painstaking process. One particularly painful process was inserting tables, which Medium does not support, into my posts. Nearly all of my posts contain numerous pandas DataFrames ( such as this one , which has 40! DataFrames) which are represented as HTML tables within a notebook. I'd take screenshots of each one to insert them into my Medium posts. Installation \u00b6 pip install jupyter_to_medium Get an Integration Token from Medium \u00b6 Before using this package, you must request an integration token from Medium. Read the instructions here on how to get your integration token . Save your integration token \u00b6 Once you have your integration token, create the following folder and file in your home directory. .jupyter_to_medium/integration_token If you don't save it, you'll need to access it every time you wish to make a new post. Usage \u00b6 There are three ways to publish notebooks: Within an active notebook From the command line Using a Python script Publishing to Medium within a Notebook \u00b6 After installation, open the notebook you wish to publish and select the option File -> Deploy as -> Medium Post Note The extension should be automatically activated in your notebook, but if the above command is not found, run the following from your command line. jupyter bundlerextension enable --py jupyter_to_medium._bundler --sys-prefix A new browser tab will open with a short form that needs to be completed. After clicking publish, the notebook and all images will be uploaded to Medium. Any HTML tables (such as pandas DataFrames) will be converted to images (via chrome), as Medium has no ability to represent tables. This is a time consuming process, so be prepared to wait. Check your terminal for updates. If successful, you'll get the following response with a link to view the post. Click the link to view the post. Finalize and publish on Medium \u00b6 As of now, your post will be published as a draft. Review and publish the post on Medium. Publishing to Medium from the Command Line \u00b6 Upon installation, you'll have access to the command line program jupyter_to_medium with the same options as the above function. jupyter_to_medium --pub-name = \"Dunder Data\" --tags = \"python, data science\" \"My Awesome Blog Post.ipynb\" Publishing to Medium with a Python Script \u00b6 In a separate script/notebook import juptyer_to_medium as a module. Pass the publish function the location of the Jupyter Notebook you would like to publish as a Medium blog post >>> import jupyter_to_medium as jtm >>> jtm . publish ( 'My Awesome Jupyter Notebook.ipynb' , integration_token = None , pub_name = None , title = None , tags = None , publish_status = 'draft' , notify_followers = False , license = 'all-rights-reserved' , canonical_url = None , chrome_path = None , download_markdown = False ) If successful, a message will be printed with the URL to your post. Additionally, JSON data will be returned as a dictionary containing the returned request from Medium. Troubleshooting \u00b6 If your post is unsuccessful, a message with the error will be printed to the screen with information that might help you solve the issue.
